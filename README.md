# P4EditVS
Simple Visual Studio extension that allows you to checkout and revert files in Perforce without slowing down or blocking your IDE. The extension does not send or collect any information, settings are only stored locally. This extensions silently fails as it does not receive any information from the Perforce server, it only issues commands to it.
